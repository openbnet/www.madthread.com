This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use MadThread.com (collectively, the  Website ), as well as any of our services, including our mobile applications widgets, plug-ins, that we created for the purposes of using the Website or our services (collectively, the  Services ), and whether you access the Website directly or through a third-party website or via one or more of the Services.</p>\r\n                            <p>We hope this information increases your confidence in MadThread and enhances your experience with MadThread.

Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We only collect Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n                            <h3>Passive Data Collection</h3>\r\n                            <p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behaviour on the Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.</p>\r\n\r\n                            <h3>Mobile Device Information</h3>\r\n                            <p>When you download or use our MadThread mobile application ( App ), we receive information about your mobile device (but not the native manufacturer unique identifier for your device) for purpose of tracking unique downloads. We register your device, and may use the identifier to send you push notifications about your transactions with our service.</p>\r\n\r\n                            <h3>Log Files</h3>\r\n                            <p>Like most websites, we automatically receive and record certain information about our users’ behavior on our Website and when using our Services. Our servers automatically gather technical information about our Website traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We aggregate this information with other pieces of information to analyze trends, to administer and improve the Services, to track users’ movements around the Website and to make inventory purchasing decisions that will best serve our customer base. Pages of the Website may also use devices that permit us to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).</p>\r\n                            <p>If we directly combine any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated forms.</p>\r\n\r\n                            <h3>Clear GIFs</h3>\r\n                            <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened.
